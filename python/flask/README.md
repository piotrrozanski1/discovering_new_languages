# Flask
Flask is a web framework, it’s a Python module that lets you develop web applications easily. It’s has a small and easy-to-extend core: it’s a microframework that doesn’t include an ORM (Object Relational Manager) or such features.

Flask is based on the Werkzeg WSGI toolkit and the Jinja2 template engine.

### WSGI
The Web Server Gateway Interface (Web Server Gateway Interface, WSGI) has been used as a standard for Python web application development. WSGI is the specification of a common interface between web servers and web applications.

### Werkzeug
Werkzeug is a WSGI toolkit that implements requests, response objects, and utility functions. This enables a web frame to be built on it. The Flask framework uses Werkzeg as one of its bases.

### jinja2
jinja2 is a popular template engine for Python.A web template system combines a template with a specific data source to render a dynamic web page.

### Microframework
Flask is often referred to as a microframework. It is designed to keep the core of the application simple and scalable.

Instead of an abstraction layer for database support, Flask supports extensions to add such capabilities to the application.
